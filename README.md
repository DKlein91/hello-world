Hello! ...world

I came here to chew bubblegum and to code...and I'm all outta bubblegum.
Seriously though, I'm here to learn. I started learning programming at the beginning of 2015 and want to develop my interest into a career. I know Java, C#, and C++ and am hungry to learn and practice more languages. Here's to a fun productive experience!
